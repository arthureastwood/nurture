        <p className='plan-para'>At the Nurture Organization we have always dreamed of having a vocational school.
             We hope to construct one where the community
             will converge and be equipped with skills that will 
             help them launch a successful career.<br /><br/>
        To accomplish this, we have plans for the school to consist of classrooms/ lecture rooms,
             administration building, kitchen, and toilets.<br/><br/>
        In addition, we also have an aim to have a pool of finances that graduated learners
             could get subsidized loans from to startup enterprises
             of their own after completing courses in the different skills.<br/><br/>
        The skills set comprises of hairdressing, cosmetology, crocheting, knitting, baking,
             catering, events planning,<br/> tailoring, shoe-making, weaving, rug-making, 
        jewelry-making, detergent-making, woodwork and carpentry, welding,
         plumbing, automotive repair, electrical works and masonry.<br/><br/>
        We are dedicated to ensuring that no one is left behind
             and that we can all come together and grow together. </p><br/><br/>
